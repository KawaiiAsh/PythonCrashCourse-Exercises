In the heart of the town named Greensville, there lay a mysterious mansion known to the locals as the ‘Whispering House’. Nobody knew why it was named so, or who lived there, but stories about it passed down through generations, giving it an aura of mystique.

In 1902, the mansion was owned by Lord Harrington, a nobleman known for his extravagant parties. Guests from all over the region would flock to the Whispering House to be part of these grand events. With chandeliers hanging from the ceilings, intricate paintings adorning the walls, and golden cutlery laid out on the tables, the mansion was a symbol of opulence.

However, as the years went by, Lord Harrington started to change. Those who met him spoke of a distant look in his eyes, as if he was constantly lost in thought. Soon, the parties stopped. The mansion, once lively, fell silent.

One fateful night, the town folks saw a bright light emanating from the mansion. The next day, Lord Harrington was nowhere to be found. The Whispering House was deserted. As days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the stories began. People claimed to hear faint whispers coming from the mansion, especially on full moon nights.

Catherine, an inquisitive journalist, had recently moved to Greensville. She was fascinated by the mansion's story and decided to investigate. With a notebook in hand, she approached the mansion one evening.

The main gate creaked open. Inside, the once-beautiful garden was now overgrown with weeds. As Catherine stepped into the mansion, she felt a cold breeze. The grand hall, which once echoed with laughter and chatter, was now filled with an eerie silence.

Catherine started exploring room by room. In the ballroom, she saw the remnants of the last party; glasses half-filled with wine and plates with morsels of food, now covered in a thick layer of dust. In Lord Harrington's study, books lay scattered everywhere, and a lone diary rested on the desk.

Curiosity piqued, Catherine started reading the diary. The entries spoke of Lord Harrington's discovery of a mysterious artifact during his travels to Egypt. It was a pendant with a bright blue gemstone. According to local legends, the gemstone had magical powers that could grant wishes but at a great cost.

As Catherine read on, she realized that Lord Harrington had started wearing the pendant constantly. He wrote of hearing voices, which grew louder with each passing day. The last entry was particularly chilling. It read, “The voices won't stop. They are demanding a price I cannot pay."
